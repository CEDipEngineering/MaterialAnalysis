Participants: [CEDipEngineering](https://github.com/CEDipEngineering), [lucaskf1996](https://github.com/lucaskf1996), [jpgianfaldoni](https://github.com/jpgianfaldoni).

In this project we were given three samples of material, one of them being AISI1020 Steel, another AISI1045 Steel, and the third being 6151 T6 Aluminum. The catch, however, was that we did not know which sample was which material. So we would run run tests and anlyze the microstructures of each sample to arrive at a conclusion.
